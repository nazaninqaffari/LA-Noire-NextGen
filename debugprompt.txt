as always, in case of backend change add backend related tests

in case of any change add patch related cases 

run all cases till you sure its debugged

the bug might be on front or back or tests, dont be bias to one side

keep debugging until you have the bugs fixed

dont use /something dirs for anything it requires authorization, you can use the tmp subdir in the proj if you needed

and finally, i recommend you run the new patch testcases only to save time, not the old one, you can create a subdir in patch dir for each patch to know what is what
