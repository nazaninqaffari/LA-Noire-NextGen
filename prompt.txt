also please follow the guidelines below:
** for frontend task, you can see the documentations and codes for backend implemented by yourself in backend dir in docs

1- Comment your code, but not excessively.
2- Document all implemented features in the doc directory.
3- Write a comprehensive testbench in the test directory.
Note: Use cookie-based authentication after login for all endpoints.
You may write helper scripts to improve testing, but ensure the CI/CD pipeline works without manual steps.
4- Keep debugging until all tests pass.
5- for working on backend Add sample requests and responses to the Swagger documentation for every endpoint you create.
6- for working on frontend, notice you should always have skeleton layout and loding screen
7- for frontend tasks, notice its important to be responsive so keep that in mind
8- keep the vibe i told you in all pages and the same theme and media vibe, again you are free to donwload anything from web if you want
9- very important * please check the urls in backend match exaclty with frontend when implementing frontend(and also the result structure), many of your bugs are because of this step *
